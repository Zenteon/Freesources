**BRDFs:**
Oren Ibar Diffuse BRDF:
    A diffuse BRDF of my own creation. While not based on any specific microfacet distribution, it passes the white furnace test, handles multiscattering, and behaves plausibly and predictably.
    It contains no trig ops, exp/log, or sqrt functions, relying entirely on basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
